      "There are three major benefits to using infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform to build and maintain your application in the Cloud. The first is being efficiency, you don't have to go into the AWS console and point-and-click for building new, optimizing or re-configuring existing, infrastructure. In the AWS portal's defense, it's not complicated (relative to, say, the concept of antimatter in particle physics), but it's still time consuming to read through, click around to find and navigate, and type things in. The second advantage of using IaC is the fact that it can be source-controlled, which drastically reduces the propensity for mistakes, because there is now an audit log of everything going on with your infrastructure.",

      "Thanks to source-controlled IaC, you and your team can validate, track and monitor what changes are being implemented, more importantly, you can debug and troubleshoot much faster. The third and final benefit is that it precludes you from having to repeat tasks, the intention with the code we are providing is for you to deploy multiple websites by just changing the domain name. IaC allows you to modularize common infrastructure patters, in addition to this example, think creating multiple VPCs for different applications by just changing CIDR ranges (e.g, 10.1.0.0/16 for one and 10.2.0.0/16 for the other) in your IaC.",

Terraform is smart enough to know that it needs to look for HCL (low-level syntax of the Terraform language) code defining cloud resources only within <code>.tf</code> files, once it gets all the code it'll organize based on the dependency graph and prepare for you. What is a <a href='https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/dependencies'>dependency graph</a> you ask?

You can use these input variables as parameters for your IaC, and this allows you to customize how your code without actually having to change any of the configuration. One of the input variables is the <code>DOMAIN_NAME</code>, which makes sense because this will vary from website to website. Moving to the output file, these are values Terraform return once it's provisioned all resources, we will need <code>route-53-hosted-zone-name-servers</code> to complete our GoDaddy configuration as you'll see.",

When writing Terraform IaC you will work with resources for the most part, but now and then you might have to rely on a data source.
