    "There are three major benefits to using infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools like Terraform to build and maintain your application in the Cloud. The first being efficiency, you don't have to go into the AWS console and point-and-click for building new, optimizing or re-configuring existing, infrastructure. In the AWS portal's defense, it's not complicated (relative to, say, the concept of antimatter in particle physics), but it's still time consuming to read through, click around to find and navigate, and type things in. The second advantage of using IaC is the fact that it can be source-controlled, which drastically reduces the propensity for mistakes, because there is now an audit log of everything in your infrastructure. Thanks to source-controlled IaC, you and your team can validate, track, and monitor what changes are being implemented. More importantly, you can debug and troubleshoot much faster.",

  {
    text:
      "The third and final benefit is that it precludes you from having to repeat tasks. The intention with the code we're providing is for you to deploy multiple websites by just changing the domain and S3 bucket name. IaC allows you to 'modularize' common infrastructure patterns, saving you time and mitigating pain from unintended consequences (think on-boarding new developers). Another example of the beauty of modularizing can be found in networking, for example, create multiple VPCs (with associated services like subnets) for different applications by just changing CIDR ranges (e.g, 10.1.0.0/16 for one and 10.2.0.0/16 for the other) in your IaC.",
