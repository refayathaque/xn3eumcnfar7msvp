## General development log
* Domain registered on GoDaddy for 3 years _autom84good.com_ - Thu Mar 4 11:04

## Prototype/blog post ideas
* Map data in CSV to NoSQL documents/objects and have script push data to managed NoSQL service in Azure/AWS
  * Must mention why it's better to keep data in cloud - More secure, automatically replicated, can be queried from anywhere because centralized, etc.
* A complete news site, look at simple ones like Dhaka Tribune and `arabnews.com`
* Incorporating Google Ads to any site
* Dockerize a Vue app, and how to use with Docker on another machine

## Thought dumps
* Use Vue slots in blog post component for main text body, component will take other things like title, keywords, author, data, etc. as props
